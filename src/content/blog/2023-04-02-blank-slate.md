I've come to realize how little my online presence speaks to what I actually do. It's more or less just me announcing project updates or releases. It doesn't really speak to my passions about software development. I want my blog to be a space for me to express those things.

From here on out, I'll try and write a blog post whenever I play around with something. Whether that be exploring a new language, finding a new way of doing things, etc.

Given that my previous blog posts were either "new site design" or completely outdated guides, they're now deleted. This means I have a fresh slate to achieve my blogging goals. Don't expect frequent posts, but I will try to ensure that they are of high quality when they do come out.
